# Kaggle---Superstore-Power-BI-Dashboard
A Power BI dashboard showing product sales from 2011 to 2014

## Description
The dashboard shows the sales trends with YoY comparison, products generating the most sales, products suffering the most loss, hot sellers, shipping methods distribution, and KPIs, such as total sales, profit margin, average handling time, total order, unit per order, and others. The dashboard is applied with DAX functions, so all the information can be correctly sliced by markets or segments. The dashboard is also applied with buttons and bookmarks, allowing users to interact better with the dashboard, switching between sales and product.

## Data
The data source is from Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/jr2ngb/superstore-data
